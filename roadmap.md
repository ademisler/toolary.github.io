# Toolary Roadmap Snapshot

This roadmap mirrors the six execution phases captured in `PLAN.md`, providing a quick-look artifact for stakeholders who do not need the full planning detail.

## Current Release (v2.0.0)

- ✅ Phase 1 – Branding & Manifest updates (Toolary naming, storage prefix migration, icon refresh)
- ✅ Phase 2 – Architecture redesign (core registry/loader, shared utilities, background wiring)
- ✅ Phase 3 – Module reorganization (category folders, manifest-driven metadata, tests updated)
- ✅ Phase 4 – Popup scalability (search, categories, favorites, recents, settings, accessibility)
- ✅ Phase 5 – Testing & validation (Jest suite with 90%+ coverage across core/share modules, lint gating)
- ✅ Phase 6 – Packaging & documentation (updated docs/privacy/changelog, Toolary 2.0.0 bundle)

## Near-Term Enhancements

1. **Design polish & theming tweaks** – Iterate on popup visuals and ensure dark-mode parity as more tools arrive.
2. **Tool catalogue growth** – Prioritise AI and utility additions once API key management lands.
3. **Automation** – Add CI hooks for lint/test/coverage and nightly smoke packages.
4. **Telemetry opt-in** (research) – Evaluate optional diagnostics while keeping default privacy stance.

## Future Considerations

- Expand language coverage beyond EN/FR/TR.
- Review keyboard shortcut collisions for power-user customisation.
- Track performance targets as the tool catalogue scales past 30 entries.
